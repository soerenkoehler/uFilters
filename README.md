# uFilters

Filter rules and receipes for:
* [uBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)
* [uMatrix](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix)

Note: In the past I was using uMatrix and uBlock in parallel. Since this meant
higher synchronizing effort and for I've got the impression that uMatrix gets a
little less love as well from the Mozilla team as in general development, I will
focus on my uBlock filters. The uMatrix files are kept for archiving purposes.
